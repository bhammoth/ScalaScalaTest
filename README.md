I wrote this in Scala with no previous scala experince and used junit for the unit testing. Requirements are outlined in the pdf in the repo. Needs some refactoring but code works and and test all pass. 

Used exceptions control flow anti-pattern since it was just a challenge. 
Need to change mutability of some vars/vals. 
Reanmes customExceptions. 
Use strings instead of numerical commands for reaadbility.
Need to extract some common logic
